# Robot Navigation and Point Cloud Alignment

This repository contains two core algorithms widely used in robotics and computer vision:

1. **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** Used for localizing a robot in 2D.  
2. **Iterative Closest Point (ICP):** Used to align 3D point clouds.

## Features

### Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Simulates robot motion with noisy measurements.
- Estimates the robotâ€™s position over time.  
- Visualizes true and estimated paths with confidence bounds.  

### Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
- Aligns two 3D point clouds using rigid transformations.  
- Computes optimal rotation and translation.  
- Visualizes alignment results.
